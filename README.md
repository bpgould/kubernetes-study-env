## Overview

There are three major motivations for this project:

1. Many tinkerers, like myself, may be interested in an abstraction that simplifies the process to set up a local kubernetes environment while still providing more extensibility than hosted platforms. Keep in mind, this cluster is designed to be used for kubernetes certification(s) preparation and not to run any real workloads.
2. Given my line of work and interests, I cannot know too much about kubernetes; I am interested in learning more about the k8s API, Golang, and SRE tooling, thus my alignment with this project.
3. I enjoy mentoring others who are transitioning into the SWE/DevOps/SRE profession. It would be useful to have a long term, public-facing project that I can use to demonstrate the ideas that I preach.

## Usage

The idea is to automate the entire process of bootstrapping a local cluster, however, initial releases will require a few manual steps to get started.
